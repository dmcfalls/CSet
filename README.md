# CSet
An implementation of the set data structure in C using an ordered array and void* interface.

The CSet is a collection to distinct objects. Has functionality for add, contains, and remove, as well as basic set operations union, intersect, difference, and power set.

Maintains the internal storage as a sorted array. Uses a client comparator function to compare elements.
